/*
Problem with (low + high) / 2:
If low and high are very large integers, adding them together could exceed the maximum value an int can store in Java.

The maximum value of int in Java is:
Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2,147,483,647
So, if:
low = 2_000_000_000
high = 2_000_000_000
Then:
(low + high) = 4_000_000_000   // This is more than Integer.MAX_VALUE
This causes an overflow, and the result becomes negative or incorrect.

âœ… Why low + (high - low) / 2 is Safer:
int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
Letâ€™s say:
low = 2_000_000_000
high = 2_000_000_010
Then:
(high - low) = 10
(high - low) / 2 = 5
mid = low + 5 = 2_000_000_005  âœ… Safe!
Since we subtract first, (high - low) will never exceed the size of the array, so the calculation always stays within the int range.

âœ… When Does Overflow Happen?
In small arrays like {5, 3, 4, 10, 40}, overflow won't happen.

But in:

Big arrays (like int[] arr = new int[1_000_000_000])

Complex systems (like large-scale search algorithms, memory-intensive programs, etc.)

You should always prefer:
int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
ðŸ§  Conclusion:
âœ… You can use (low + high) / 2 safely in small programs, but in professional or large-scale systems, always use:

int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
