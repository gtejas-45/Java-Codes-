//    Simplicity means
//   1) The language is easy to learn, write, and understand.
//   2) It avoids complex features found in other languages (like pointers in C/C++).
//   3) Syntax is clean, consistent, and logical.

//Why is Java Simple?
//        Feature	                       ->      Explanation
//        No pointers	                   ->      Reduces confusion and errors
//        Automatic memory management	   ->      Garbage Collector handles memory
//        Rich API and built-in libraries  ->      Less code to write
//        Easy syntax	                   ->      Similar to English and C-based languages
